## About PUMP

SALT35 is proud to host a [Pop-Up Mentoring Program](https://genderinlinguistics.org/pump/) (PUMP) event, sponsered by the LSA Committee on Gender Equity. 
PUMP provides on-site, one-off mentoring meetings at linguistics conferences around the world. 
The event matches one or more mentees with mentors who can provide quick but personalized career advice to linguists at any stage, in any location, and in any career: anyone can be a mentee or mentor, the more the merrier.

We almost always have a lot of mentee interest so we especially encourage participants to apply as mentors if they think they can. Anyone can be a mentor! PhD students can mentor MA students, postdocs can be a wonderful resource for senior grad students, Assistant professors can mentor postdocs, and so on. We keep career stage and interests in mind when matching mentors and mentees. Registration for mentor and mentee application will be available soon!
