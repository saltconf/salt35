## About PUMP

<img src="/salt35/assets/images/pump-logo.svg" alt="PUMP logo" width="300" />


SALT35 is proud to host a [Pop-Up Mentoring Program](https://genderinlinguistics.org/pump/) (PUMP) event, sponsored by the LSA Committee on Gender Equity. 
PUMP provides on-site, one-off mentoring meetings at linguistics conferences around the world. 
The event matches one or more mentees with mentors who can provide quick but personalized career advice to linguists at any stage, in any location, and in any career: anyone can be a mentee or mentor, the more the merrier.


You can register as a mentor or a mentee [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSch6vBHw6H6aZaDcA3GedzZlS30e32JHR9zHDx0f6QUYy6MvQ/viewform). We almost always have a lot of mentee interest so we especially encourage participants to apply as mentors if they think they can. Anyone can be a mentor! PhD students can mentor MA students, postdocs can be a wonderful resource for senior grad students, Assistant professors can mentor postdocs, and so on. We keep career stage and interests in mind when matching mentors and mentees. The deadline for registering as a mentee or a mentor for this event is Tuesday, May 13, 2025, 11:59 PM  EST. After you register, you will receive an email matching you with your mentor or mentee, with details about how to meet. Please email hkotek@gmail.com with any questions about the PUMP event. PUMP@SALT 35 is scheduled on <b> Wednesday, May 21, 2025, 1:00 PM â€“ 2:00 PM  EST at the Clover Food Lab in the Science Center </b>. Alternatively, matched participants are welcome to agree on a different time to meet.
