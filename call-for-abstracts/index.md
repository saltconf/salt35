The organizers of the 35th annual meeting of Semantics and Linguistic Theory (SALT34) invite submission of abstracts for 30-minute oral presentations (with an additional 10 minutes for questions) or posters on any topic in natural language semantics with relevance to linguistic theory. 

SALT34 will be held solely in-person, and there will be no remote presentation or attendance option.

Submissions should be made via the [SALT35 OpenReview site](https://openreview.net/group?id=saltconf.github.io/SALT/2025). We expect to notify authors of their acceptance in February 2025.

Please note that creating an account on the OpenReview platform can sometimes  take a little time to get fully activated (12 hours or so). If you plan to submit and do not have an OpenReview account, please make sure to please do so as soon as possible in order to ensure that the account is active before the deadline.

**Update (12/1/23):** Due to technical difficulties experienced by some submitters, the submission deadline has been extended to Monday, December 4, 2023, 11:59 pm anywhere in the world (UTC-12). The main technical difficulty that submitters have experienced has to do with the fact that it can (though often does not) take 12 hours for an OpenReview account to be activated. If you plan to submit and have not made an OpenReview account yet, please do so as soon as possible in order to ensure that the account is active before the new deadline.

## Requirements

Abstracts must be anonymous. The main text should be at most 2 pages (US Letter or A4) in length, with an optional third page for examples, references, or figures. The abstract should use a 12pt font and 1 inch margins (for US Letter) or 3 cm margins (for A4) on all four sides. The abstract must be submitted as a single PDF file. These limitations will be strictly enforced. 

SALT 35 will feature a poster session. Poster presentations will be published as regular papers in the proceedings. Poster presenters will be asked to give a short lightning round presentation prior to the poster session.

**Clarification (11/4/23):** English context descriptions for non-English examples may be placed on the third page alongside the example they are associated with, but they must obey the constraint for figure captions on the third page–i.e. they must not exceed 100 characters in length. If longer English context descriptions are necessary–even for non-English examples that themselves are placed on the third page–they must be interleaved within the main text of the abstract.

The abstract should use a font no smaller than 12pt for all text (including mathematical formulae, examples, figure captions, and footnotes), and its margins should be no smaller than 1 inch (for US Letter) or 3 cm margins (for A4) on all four sides. The line spacing must be no smaller than single space. The abstract must be submitted as a single PDF file. These limitations will be strictly enforced. In addition to the intellectual interest of the abstract, clarity and readability will also be taken into account in reviewing.

## Policies

Authors may be involved in at most two abstracts and may be the sole author of at most one abstract.

SALT does not accept papers that at the time of the conference have been published or have been accepted for publication. In addition, preference will be given to presentations that are not duplicated at other major conferences. We therefore request that authors indicate prior, pending, or planned presentations of their papers along with their contact information when they submit their abstracts.

## Proceedings

All papers presented at the conference (including posters) will be published in a SALT35 volume following the conclusion of the conference.
