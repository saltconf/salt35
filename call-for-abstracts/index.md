The organizers of the 34th annual meeting of Semantics and Linguistic Theory (SALT34) invite submission of abstracts for 30-minute oral presentations (with an additional 10 minutes for questions) or posters on any topic in natural language semantics with relevance to linguistic theory. 

SALT34 will be held solely in-person, and there will be no remote presentation or attendance option.

## Submission details

**<span class="alert">Deadline:</span> Friday, December 1, 2023**, 11:59pm anywhere on Earth (UTC-12)

Submissions should be made via the [SALT34 OpenReview site](https://openreview.net/group?id=saltconf.github.io/SALT/2024/Conference). We expect to notify authors of acceptance decisions in mid-February 2024.

## Requirements

Abstracts must be anonymous. The main text should be at most 2 pages (US Letter or A4) in length, with an optional third page for references, figures, or non-English examples. All English examples must be interleaved within the main text of the abstract. No prose may extend onto the third page and captions for figures on the third page must not exceed 100 characters in length.

The abstract should use a font no smaller than 12pt for all text (including mathematical formulae, examples, figure captions, and footnotes), and its margins should be no smaller than 1 inch (for US Letter) or 3 cm margins (for A4) on all four sides. The line spacing must be no smaller than single space. The abstract must be submitted as a single PDF file. These limitations will be strictly enforced. In addition to the intellectual interest of the abstract, clarity and readability will also be taken into account in reviewing.

## Policies

Authors may be involved in an unlimited number of abstracts, but they may be involved in at most one as first author and at most two as last author. For a single author abstract, the sole author counts as both the first and the last author for the purposes of this constraint; and for a two author abstract, the second author counts as the last author for the purposes of this constraint.

SALT does not accept papers that at the time of the conference have been published or have been accepted for publication. In addition, preference will be given to presentations that are not duplicated at other major conferences. We therefore request that authors indicate prior, pending, or planned presentations of their papers along with their contact information when they submit their abstracts.

## Proceedings

All papers presented at the conference (including posters) will be published in a SALT34 volume following the conclusion of the conference.
